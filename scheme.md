# Scheme Programming Lessons from Tarot

This page is for documenting things learned from implementing tarot, a basic self hosted scheme compiler that I did.

## Table of contents

* [sequences](scheme-1) - constructing complicated lists efficiently.
* [accessors](scheme-2) - breaking apart data structures in a simple way.
* [stacks and queues](scheme-3) - hammer and screwdriver, for programming.
* [syntactic extension](scheme-4) - making things easy with macros!
* [qcode](scheme-5) - some low level details about the compiler target and virtual machine.
