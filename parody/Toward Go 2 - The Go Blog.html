    [This is the text of my talk today


    at Gophercon 2017, asking for the entire Go community's


    help as we discuss and plan Go 2.


    We will add a link to the video when it becomes available.]
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    On September 25, 2007, after Rob Pike, Robert Griesemer, and Ken


    Thompson had been discussing a new programming language for a few


    days, Rob suggested the name “Go.”
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

</div>

  
  <p>
    The next year, Ian Lance Taylor and I joined the team, and together


    the five of us built two compilers and a standard library, leading up


    to the <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2009/11/hey-ho-lets-go.html" target="_blank">open-source release</a> on November 10, 2009.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

<div class="image">

</div>
</div>

  
  <p>
    For the next two years, with the help of the new Go open source


    community, we experimented with changes large and small, refining Go


    and leading to the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/preview-of-go-version-1" target="_blank">plan for Go 1</a>, proposed on October 5, 2011.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

<div class="image">
  <img src="./Toward Go 2 - The Go Blog_files/go1-preview.png" width="560">
</div>
</div>

  
  <p>
    With more help from the Go community, we revised and implemented that


    plan, eventually <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go-version-1-is-released" target="_blank">releasing Go 1</a> on March 28, 2012.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

<div class="image">
  <img src="./Toward Go 2 - The Go Blog_files/go1-release.png" width="556">
</div>
</div>

  
  <p>
    The release of Go 1 marked the culmination of nearly five years of


    creative, frenetic effort that took us from a name and a list of ideas


    to a stable, production language. It also marked an explicit shift


    from change and churn to stability.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    In the years leading to Go 1, we changed Go and broke everyone's Go


    programs nearly every week. We understood that this was keeping Go


    from use in production settings, where programs could not be rewritten


    weekly to keep up with language changes.


    As the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/go-version-1-is-released" target="_blank">blog post announcing Go 1</a> says, the driving motivation was to provide a stable foundation


    for creating reliable products, projects, and publications (blogs,


    tutorials, conference talks, and books), to make users confident that


    their programs would continue to compile and run without change for


    years to come.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    After Go 1 was released, we knew that we needed to spend time using Go


    in the production environments it was designed for. We shifted


    explicitly away from making language changes toward using Go in our


    own projects and improving the implementation: we ported Go to many


    new systems, we rewrote nearly every performance-critical piece to


    make Go run more efficiently, and we added key tools like the


    <a href="https://blog.golang.org/race-detector" target="_blank">race detector</a>.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Now we have five years of experience using Go to build large,


    production-quality systems. We have developed a sense of what works


    and what does not. Now it is time to begin the next step in Go's


    evolution and growth, to plan the future of Go. I'm here today to ask


    all of you in the Go community, whether you're in the audience at


    GopherCon or watching on video or reading the Go blog later today, to


    work with us as we plan and implement Go 2.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    In the rest of this talk, I'm going to explain our goals for Go 2; our


    constraints and limitations; the overall process; the importance of


    writing about our experiences using Go, especially as they relate to


    problems we might try to solve; the possible kinds of solutions; how


    we will deliver Go 2; and how all of you can help.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_2.">Goals</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    The goals we have for Go today are the same as in 2007. We want to


    make programmers more effective at managing two kinds of scale:


    production scale, especially concurrent systems interacting with many


    other servers, exemplified today by cloud software; and development


    scale, especially large codebases worked on by many engineers


    coordinating only loosely, exemplified today by modern open-source


    development.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    These kinds of scale show up at companies of all sizes. Even a


    five-person startup may use large cloud-based API services provided by


    other companies and use more open-source software than software they


    write themselves. Production scale and development scale are just as


    relevant at that startup as they are at Google.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Our goal for Go 2 is to fix the most significant ways Go fails to


    scale.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    (For more about these goals, see


    Rob Pike's 2012 article “<a href="https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article" target="_blank">Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering</a>”


    and my GopherCon 2015 talk “<a href="https://blog.golang.org/open-source" target="_blank">Go, Open Source, Community</a>.”)
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_3.">Constraints</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    The goals for Go have not changed since the beginning, but the


    constraints on Go certainly have. The most important constraint is


    existing Go usage. We estimate that there are at least


    <a href="https://research.swtch.com/gophercount" target="_blank">half a million Go developers worldwide</a>,


    which means there are millions of Go source files and at


    least a billion of lines of Go code. Those programmers and that source


    code represent Go's success, but they are also the main constraint on


    Go 2.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Go 2 must bring along all those developers. We must ask them to


    unlearn old habits and learn new ones only when the reward is great.


    For example, before Go 1, the method implemented by error types was


    named <code>String</code>. In Go 1, we renamed it <code>Error</code>, to distinguish error types


    from other types that can format themselves. The other day I was


    implementing an error type, and without thinking I named its method


    <code>String</code> instead of <code>Error</code>, which of course did not compile. After five


    years I still have not completely unlearned the old way. That kind of


    clarifying renaming was an important change to make in Go 1 but would


    be too disruptive for Go 2 without a very good reason.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Go 2 must also bring along all the existing Go 1 source code. We must


    not split the Go ecosystem. Mixed programs, in which packages written


    in Go 2 import packages written in Go 1 and vice versa, must work


    effortlessly during a transition period of multiple years. We'll have


    to figure out exactly how to do that; automated tooling like go fix


    will certainly play a part.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    To minimize disruption, each change will require careful thought,


    planning, and tooling, which in turn limits the number of changes we


    can make. Maybe we can do two or three, certainly not more than five.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    I'm not counting minor housekeeping changes like maybe allowing identifiers


    in more spoken languages or adding binary integer literals. Minor


    changes like these are also important, but they are easier to get


    right. I'm focusing today on possible major changes, such as


    additional support for error handling, or introducing immutable or


    read-only values, or adding some form of generics, or other important


    topics not yet suggested. We can do only a few of those major changes.


    We will have to choose carefully.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_4.">Process</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    That raises an important question. What is the process for developing


    Go?
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    In the early days of Go, when there were just five of us, we worked in


    a pair of adjacent shared offices separated by a glass wall. It was


    easy to pull everyone into one office to discuss some problem and then


    go back to our desks to implement a solution. When some wrinkle arose


    during the implementation, it was easy to gather everyone again. Rob


    and Robert's office had a small couch and a whiteboard, so typically


    one of us went in and started writing an example on the board. Usually


    by the time the example was up, everyone else had reached a good


    stopping point in their own work and was ready to sit down and discuss


    it. That informality obviously doesn't scale to the global Go


    community of today.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Part of the work since the open-source release of Go has been porting


    our informal process into the more formal world of mailing lists and


    issue trackers and half a million users, but I don't think we've ever


    explicitly described our overall process. It's possible we never


    consciously thought about it. Looking back, though, I think this is


    the basic outline of our work on Go, the process we've been following


    since the first prototype was running.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

<div class="image">
  <img src="./Toward Go 2 - The Go Blog_files/process.png" width="410">
</div>
</div>

  
  <p>
    Step 1 is to use Go, to accumulate experience with it.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Step 2 is to identify a problem with Go that might need solving and to


    articulate it, to explain it to others, to write it down.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Step 3 is to propose a solution to that problem, discuss it with


    others, and revise the solution based on that discussion.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Step 4 is to implement the solution, evaluate it, and refine it based


    on that evaluation.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Finally, step 5 is to ship the solution, adding it to the language, or


    the library, or the set of tools that people use from day to day.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    The same person does not have to do all these steps for a particular


    change. In fact, usually many people collaborate on any given step,


    and many solutions may be proposed for a single problem. Also, at any


    point we may realize we don’t want to go further with a particular


    idea and circle back to an earlier step.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Although I don't believe we've ever talked about this process as a


    whole, we have explained parts of it. In 2012, when we released Go 1


    and said that it was time now to use Go and stop changing it, we were


    explaining step 1. In 2015, when we introduced the Go change proposal


    process, we were explaining steps 3, 4, and 5. But we've never


    explained step 2 in detail, so I'd like to do that now.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    (For more about the development of Go 1 and the shift away from


    language changes, see Rob Pike and Andrew Gerrand's


    OSCON 2012 talk “<a href="https://blog.golang.org/the-path-to-go-1" target="_blank">The Path to Go 1</a>.”


    For more about the proposal process, see


    Andrew Gerrand's GopherCon 2015 talk “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ht89TxZZnk" target="_blank">How Go was Made</a>” and the


    <a href="https://golang.org/s/proposal" target="_blank">proposal process documentation</a>.)
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_5.">Explaining Problems</h4>
  <div style="margin-left: 2em;">

<div class="image">
  <img src="./Toward Go 2 - The Go Blog_files/process2.png" width="410">
</div>
</div>

  
  <p>
    There are two parts to explaining a problem. The first part—the easier


    part—is stating exactly what the problem is. We developers are


    decently good at this. After all, every test we write is a statement


    of a problem to be solved, in language so precise that even a computer


    can understand it. The second part—the harder part—is describing the


    significance of the problem well enough that everyone can understand


    why we should spend time solving it and maintaining a solution. In


    contrast to stating a problem precisely, we don't need to describe a


    problem's significance very often, and we're not nearly as good at it.


    Computers never ask us “why is this test case important? Are you sure


    this is the problem you need to solve? Is solving this problem the


    most important thing you can be doing?” Maybe they will someday, but


    not today.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Let's look at an old example from 2011. Here is what I wrote about


    renaming os.Error to error.Value while we were planning Go 1.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">

<div class="image">
  <img src="./Toward Go 2 - The Go Blog_files/error.png" width="495">
</div>
</div>

  
  <p>
    It begins with a precise, one-line statement of the problem: in very


    low-level libraries everything imports "os" for os.Error. Then there


    are five lines, which I've underlined here, devoted to describing the


    significance of the problem: the packages that "os" uses cannot


    themselves present errors in their APIs, and other packages depend on


    "os" for reasons having nothing to do with operating system services.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Do these five lines convince <i>you</i> that this problem is significant?


    It depends on how well you can fill in the context I've left out:


    being understood requires anticipating what others need to know. For


    my audience at the time—the ten other people on the Go team at Google


    who were reading that document—those fifty words were enough. To


    present the same problem to the audience at GothamGo last fall—an


    audience with much more varied backgrounds and areas of expertise—I


    needed to provide more context, and I used about two hundred words,


    along with real code examples and a diagram. It is a fact of today's


    worldwide Go community that describing the significance of any problem


    requires adding context, especially illustrated by concrete examples,


    that you would leave out when talking to coworkers.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Convincing others that a problem is significant is an essential step.


    When a problem appears insignificant, almost every solution will seem


    too expensive. But for a significant problem, there are usually many


    solutions of reasonable cost. When we disagree about whether to adopt


    a particular solution, we're often actually disagreeing about the


    significance of the problem being solved. This is so important that I


    want to look at two recent examples that show this clearly, at least


    in hindsight.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  <h4 id="TOC_5.1.">Example: Leap seconds</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    My first example is about time.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Suppose you want to time how long an event takes. You write down the


    start time, run the event, write down the end time, and then subtract


    the start time from the end time. If the event took ten milliseconds,


    the subtraction gives a result of ten milliseconds, perhaps plus or


    minus a small measurement error.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>start := time.Now()       // 3:04:05.000
event()
end := time.Now()         // 3:04:05.010

elapsed := end.Sub(start) // 10 ms</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    This obvious procedure can fail during a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second" target="_blank">leap second</a>. When our clocks


    are not quite in sync with the daily rotation of the Earth, a leap


    second—officially 11:59pm and 60 seconds—is inserted just before


    midnight. Unlike leap years, leap seconds follow no predictable


    pattern, which makes them hard to fit into programs and APIs. Instead


    of trying to represent the occasional 61-second minute, operating


    systems typically implement a leap second by turning the clock back


    one second just before what would have been midnight, so that 11:59pm


    and 59 seconds happens twice. This clock reset makes time appear to


    move backward, so that our ten-millisecond event might be timed as


    taking negative 990 milliseconds.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>start := time.Now()       // 11:59:59.995
event()
end := time.Now()         // 11:59:59.005 (really 11:59:60.005)

elapsed := end.Sub(start) // –990 ms</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    Because the time-of-day clock is inaccurate for timing events across


    clock resets like this, operating systems now provide a second clock,


    the monotonic clock, which has no absolute meaning but counts seconds


    and is never reset.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Except during the odd clock reset, the monotonic clock is no better


    than the time-of-day clock, and the time-of-day clock has the added


    benefit of being useful for telling time, so for simplicity Go 1’s


    time APIs expose only the time-of-day clock.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    In October 2015, a <a href="https://golang.org/issue/12914" target="_blank">bug report</a> noted that Go programs could not time


    events correctly across clock resets, especially a typical leap second.


    The suggested fix was also the original issue title: “add a new API to access a


    monotonic clock source.” I argued that this problem was not


    significant enough to justify new API. A few months earlier, for the


    mid-2015 leap second, Akamai, Amazon, and Google had slowed their


    clocks a tiny amount for the entire day, absorbing the extra second


    without turning their clocks backward. It seemed like eventual


    widespread adoption of this “<a href="https://developers.google.com/time/smear" target="_blank">leap smear</a>” approach would eliminate


    leap-second clock resets as a problem on production systems. In


    contrast, adding new API to Go would add new problems: we would have


    to explain the two kinds of clocks, educate users about when to use


    each, and convert many lines of existing code, all for an issue that


    rarely occurred and might plausibly go away on its own.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    We did what we always do when there's a problem without a clear


    solution: we waited. Waiting gives us more time to add experience and


    understanding of the problem and also more time to find a good


    solution. In this case, waiting added to our understanding of the


    significance of the problem, in the form of a thankfully


    <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/01/04/cloudflare_trips_over_leap_second/" target="_blank">minor outage at Cloudflare</a>.


    Their Go code timed DNS requests during the end-of-2016


    leap second as taking around negative 990 milliseconds, which caused


    simultaneous panics across their servers, breaking 0.2% of DNS queries


    at peak.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Cloudflare is exactly the kind of cloud system Go was intended for,


    and they had a production outage based on Go not being able to time


    events correctly. Then, and this is the key point, Cloudflare reported


    their experience in a blog post by John Graham-Cumming titled


    “<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-and-why-the-leap-second-affected-cloudflare-dns/" target="_blank">How and why the leap second affected Cloudflare DNS</a>.” By sharing concrete


    details of their experience with Go in production, John and Cloudflare helped us


    understand that the problem of accurate timing across leap second


    clock resets was too significant to leave unfixed. Two months after


    that article was published, we had designed and implemented a solution


    that will <a href="https://beta.golang.org/doc/go1.9#monotonic-time" target="_blank">ship in Go 1.9</a>


    (and in fact we did it with <a href="https://golang.org/design/12914-monotonic" target="_blank">no new API</a>).
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  


  <h4 id="TOC_5.2.">Example: Alias declarations</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    My second example is support for alias declarations in Go.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Over the past few years, Google has established a team focused on


    large-scale code changes, meaning API migration and bug fixes applied


    across our


    <a href="http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/pdf" target="_blank">codebase of millions of source files and billions of lines of code</a>


    written in C++, Go, Java, Python, and other languages. One


    thing I've learned from that team's work is the importance, when


    changing an API from using one name to another, of being able to


    update client code in multiple steps, not all at once. To do this, it


    must be possible to write a declaration forwarding uses of the old


    name to the new name. C++ has #define, typedef, and using declarations


    to enable this forwarding, but Go has nothing. Of course, one of Go's


    goals is to scale well to large codebases, and as the amount of Go


    code at Google grew, it became clear both that we needed some kind of


    forwarding mechanism and also that other projects and companies would


    run into this problem as their Go codebases grew.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    In March 2016, I started talking with Robert Griesemer and Rob Pike


    about how Go might handle gradual codebase updates, and we arrived at


    alias declarations, which are exactly the needed forwarding mechanism.


    At this point, I felt very good about the way Go was evolving. We'd


    talked about aliases since the early days of Go—in fact, the first


    spec draft has <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/18c5b488a3b2e218c0e0cf2a7d4820d9da93a554/doc/go_spec#1182" target="_blank">an example using alias declarations</a>—but each time we'd


    discussed aliases, and later type aliases, we had no clear use case


    for them, so we left them out. Now we were proposing to add aliases


    not because they were an elegant concept but because they solved a


    significant practical problem with Go meeting its goal of scalable


    software development. I hoped this would serve as a model for future


    changes to Go.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Later in the spring, Robert and Rob wrote <a href="https://golang.org/design/16339-alias-decls" target="_blank">a proposal</a>,


    and Robert presented it in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-w6MyI2qlU" target="_blank">Gophercon 2016 lightning talk</a>. The next few months


    did not go smoothly, and they were definitely not a model for future


    changes to Go. One of the many lessons we learned was the importance


    of describing the significance of a problem.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    A minute ago, I explained the problem to you, giving some background


    about how it can arise and why, but with no concrete examples that


    might help you evaluate whether the problem might affect you at some


    point. Last summer’s proposal and the lightning talk gave an abstract


    example, involving packages C, L, L1, and C1 through Cn, but no


    concrete examples that developers could relate to. As a result, most


    of the feedback from the community was based on the idea that aliases


    only solved a problem for Google, not for everyone else.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Just as we at Google did not at first understand the significance of


    handling leap second time resets correctly, we did not effectively


    convey to the broader Go community the significance of handling


    gradual code migration and repair during large-scale changes.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    In the fall we started over. I gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6Cw9iCDVcU" target="_blank">talk</a> and wrote 


    <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2016/refactor.article" target="_blank">an article presenting the problem</a>


    using multiple concrete examples drawn from


    open source codebases, showing how this problem arises everywhere, not


    just inside Google. Now that more people understood the problem and


    could see its significance, we had a <a href="https://golang.org/issue/18130" target="_blank">productive discussion</a> about what


    kind of solution would be best. The outcome is that <a href="https://golang.org/design/18130-type-alias" target="_blank">type aliases</a> will


    be <a href="https://beta.golang.org/doc/go1.9#language" target="_blank">included in Go 1.9</a> and will help Go scale to ever-larger codebases.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  


  <h4 id="TOC_5.3.">Experience reports</h4>
  
  
  <p>
    The lesson here is that it is difficult but essential to describe the


    significance of a problem in a way that someone working in a different


    environment can understand. To discuss major changes to Go as a


    community, we will need to pay particular attention to describing the


    significance of any problem we want to solve. The clearest way to do


    that is by showing how the problem affects real programs and real


    production systems, like in 


    <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-and-why-the-leap-second-affected-cloudflare-dns/" target="_blank">Cloudflare's blog post</a> and in


    <a href="https://talks.golang.org/2016/refactor.article" target="_blank">my refactoring article</a>.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Experience reports like these turn an abstract problem into a concrete


    one and help us understand its significance. They also serve as test


    cases: any proposed solution can be evaluated by examining its effect


    on the actual, real-world problems the reports describe.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    For example, I've been examining generics recently, but I don't have


    in my mind a clear picture of the detailed, concrete problems that Go


    users need generics to solve. As a result, I can't answer a design


    question like whether to support generic methods, which is to say


    methods that are parameterized separately from the receiver. If we had


    a large set of real-world use cases, we could begin to answer a


    question like this by examining the significant ones.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    As another example, I’ve seen proposals to extend the error interface


    in various ways, but I haven't seen any experience reports showing how


    large Go programs attempt to understand and handle errors at all, much


    less showing how the current error interface hinders those attempts.


    These reports would help us all better understand the details and


    significance of the problem, which we must do before solving it.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    I could go on. Every major potential change to Go should be motivated


    by one or more experience reports documenting how people use Go today


    and why that's not working well enough. For the obvious major changes


    we might consider for Go, I'm not aware of many such reports,


    especially not reports illustrated with real-world examples.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    These reports are the raw material for the Go 2 proposal process, and


    we need all of you to write them, to help us understand your


    experiences with Go. There are half a million of you, working in a


    broad range of environments, and not that many of us.

  <p>
    Now that we know how we're going to identify and explain problems that


    need to be solved, I want to note briefly that not all problems are


    best solved by language changes, and that's fine.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    One problem we might want to solve is that computers can often compute


    additional results during basic arithmetic operations, but Go does not


    provide direct access to those results. In 2013, Robert proposed that


    we might extend the idea of two-result (“comma-ok”) expressions to


    basic arithmetic. For example, if x and y are, say, uint32 values,


    <code>lo, hi = x * y</code>


    would return not only the usual low 32 bits but also the high 32 bits


    of the product. This problem didn't seem particularly significant, so


    we <a href="https://golang.org/issue/6815" target="_blank">recorded the potential solution</a> but didn't implement it. We waited.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    More recently, we designed for Go 1.9 a <a href="https://beta.golang.org/doc/go1.9#math-bits" target="_blank">math/bits package</a> that


    contains various bit manipulation functions:
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <div class="code"><pre>package bits // import "math/bits"

func LeadingZeros32(x uint32) int
func Len32(x uint32) int
func OnesCount32(x uint32) int
func Reverse32(x uint32) uint32
func ReverseBytes32(x uint32) uint32
func RotateLeft32(x uint32, k int) uint32
func TrailingZeros32(x uint32) int
...</pre></div>
  

  
  <p>
    The package has good Go


    implementations of each function, but the compilers also substitute


    special hardware instructions when available. Based on this experience


    with math/bits, both Robert and I now believe that making the


    additional arithmetic results available by changing the language is


    unwise, and that instead we should define appropriate functions in a


    package like math/bits. Here the best solution is a library change,


    not a language change.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    A different problem we might have wanted to solve, after Go 1.0, was


    the fact that goroutines and shared memory make it too easy to


    introduce races into Go programs, causing crashes and other


    misbehavior in production. The language-based solution would have been


    to find some way to disallow data races, to make it impossible to


    write or at least to compile a program with a data race. How to fit


    that into a language like Go is still an open question in the


    programming language world. Instead we added a tool to the main


    distribution and made it trivial to use: that tool, the <a href="https://blog.golang.org/race-detector" target="_blank">race detector</a>, has become


    an indispensible part of the Go experience. Here the best solution was


    a runtime and tooling change, not a language change.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    There will be language changes as well, of course, but not all


    problems are best solved in the language.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  


    
      
  <h4 id="TOC_7.">Shipping Go 2</h4>
  <div style="margin-left: 2em;">

<div class="image">
  <img src="./Toward Go 2 - The Go Blog_files/process5.png" width="410">
</div>
</div>

  
  <p>
    Finally, how will we ship and deliver Go 2?
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    I think the best plan would be to ship the <a href="https://golang.org/doc/go1compat" target="_blank">backwards-compatible parts</a>


    of Go 2 incrementally, feature by feature, as part of the Go 1 release


    sequence. This has a few important properties. First, it keeps the Go


    1 releases on the <a href="https://golang.org/wiki/Go-Release-Cycle" target="_blank">usual schedule</a>, to continue the timely bug fixes and


    improvements that users now depend on. Second, it avoids splitting


    development effort between Go 1 and Go 2. Third, it avoids divergence


    between Go 1 and Go 2, to ease everyone's eventual migration. Fourth,


    it allows us to focus on and deliver one change at a time, which


    should help maintain quality. Fifth, it will encourage us to design


    features to be backwards-compatible.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    We will need time to discuss and plan before any changes start landing in


    Go 1 releases, but it seems plausible to me that we might start seeing


    minor changes about a year from now, for Go 1.12 or so. That also


    gives us time to land package management support first.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    Once all the backwards-compatible work is done, say in Go 1.20, then


    we can make the backwards-incompatible changes in Go 2.0. If there


    turn out to be no backwards-incompatible changes, maybe we just


    declare that Go 1.20 <i>is</i> Go 2.0. Either way, at that point we will


    transition from working on the Go 1.X release sequence to working on


    the Go 2.X sequence, perhaps with an extended support window for the


    final Go 1.X release.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
  

  
  <p>
    This is all a bit speculative, and the specific release numbers


    I just mentioned are placeholders for ballpark estimates,


    but I want to make clear that we're not


    abandoning Go 1, and that in fact we will bring Go 1 along to the


    greatest extent possible.
  But what about the lack of generics?</p>
