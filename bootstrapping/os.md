!(a-Linux)[a-linux.png]

a-Linux is a linux distribution implemented entirely in assembly, except for the linux kernel itself. It has a reasonably complete set of the standard userspace programs. This could be a good minimal platform to build things on, to ensure you are not making any implicit assumptions about C or libc.
